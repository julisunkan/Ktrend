I want to build a full-featured Flask web app called "KDP Keyword Research Tool" that helps Amazon KDP authors and publishers find profitable book keywords and trending topics using only free APIs and scraping methods. The app must include all of the following features, organized in a clean project structure.

📂 Project structure:
kdp_tool/
│── app.py (Flask routes and main logic)
│── requirements.txt (dependencies)
│── static/
│    ├── css/ (custom styles, Bootstrap or Tailwind)
│    └── js/ (JavaScript for filtering, export, charts)
│── templates/
│    ├── base.html (layout with dark mode toggle)
│    ├── index.html (dashboard with table + charts)
│    ├── report.html (PDF export template)
│── utils/
│    ├── keyword_gen.py (Google Autocomplete, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia titles, bulk expansion)
│    ├── trends.py (Google Trends via pytrends, YouTube trending scraper, Twitter RSS, Quora/StackExchange questions)
│    ├── amazon.py (Amazon search results count, categories, competitor analysis)
│    ├── analysis.py (Keyword Difficulty, Profitability Score, clustering/grouping with scikit-learn)
│    ├── export.py (Export to CSV, Excel, PDF with reportlab)
│    └── nlp_tools.py (Synonyms via WordNet, N-grams, phrase builder)
│── db.sqlite3 (for saving sessions and favorites)

📦 Dependencies (requirements.txt):
flask
requests
beautifulsoup4
lxml
pytrends
nltk
scikit-learn
pandas
reportlab
openpyxl

💡 Features to implement:
1. Keyword Research
   - Expand keyword ideas from Google Autocomplete, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia.
   - Generate synonyms using WordNet.

   - Extract questions from Quora or StackExchange.

3. Amazon Competitor Analysis

   - Estimate competition.

4. Keyword Analysis & Scoring
   - Calculate Keyword Difficulty Score (competition + volume).
   - Rank profitability (low competition + demand).
   - Cluster related keywords into groups.

5. Dashboard (Frontend)
   - Search bar + bulk input.
   - Results table with filters, sorting, and color-coded highlights (green = high potential, red = too competitive).
   - Interactive charts (Chart.js) for keyword vs. search volume, profitability, and trends.
   - Copy-to-clipboard button for each keyword.
   - Star/favorite button for saving keywords (stored in SQLite).
   - Dark mode / light mode toggle.
   - Responsive mobile-friendly UI with Bootstrap or Tailwind.

6. Export & Storage
   - Export filtered table to CSV, Excel, and PDF report.
   - Generate branded PDF reports (with charts and keyword stats).
   - Save research sessions in SQLite and reload later.
   - Auto-save the last session.
   - Multi-language support (English + Spanish).
   - Auto-fetch and display daily trending book topics on homepage.

7. Utility
   - Auto-backup sessions.
   - Favorites list page.
   - Undo/redo filtering (optional, client-side).
   - About/help page.

⚙️ Flask config:
- Use `app.py` with all routes wired.
- At the bottom, include:
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, debug=True)

Deliverables:
- Fully working Flask app with all utils modules implemented.
- Templates styled with Bootstrap/Tailwind, including dark mode toggle and charts.
- Export buttons (CSV, Excel, PDF).
- SQLite database for sessions and favorites.
- Ready to run on Replit with `python app.py`.

Make sure every feature above is implemented. Do not skip any.
